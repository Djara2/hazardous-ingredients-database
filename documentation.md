# Predicates

Predicates are ordered according to:
1. The classification of the ingredient.
2. What the ingredient affects (for certain).
3. What the ingredient is linked to (like #2; however, less certainly).

## Ingredient Classification Predicates

There are 3 classifications
1. hazardous.
2. risky.
3. safe.

`hazardous/1` is the classification for all ingredients for which there is no reason to consume them; it is the classification for ingredients that will certainly do more harm than good - ingreidents with no way to consume them in moderation.

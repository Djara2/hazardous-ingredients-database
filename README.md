# hazardous-ingredients-database

Database for checking if certain ingredients and food items are potentially hazardous to one's health.

This is an open source database and personal learning experiment for determining whether or not common food, cosmetic, and hygenie products contain hazardous ingredients. One may also determine what bodily effects these ingredients have (for certain), and what effects ingredients are believed to be linked to.

This application is inspired by [Yuka](https://yuka.io/en/); however, it is better thought of as a free and open source desktop alternative to the Yuka mobile application.
